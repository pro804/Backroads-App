          <p>
            At Backroads, we believe travel should be an adventure that immerses
            you in the heart of a destination, not just a sightseeing checklist.
            We go beyond the tourist trails to connect you with stunning
            landscapes, local cultures, and hidden gems you'd never find on your
            own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our expert local guides, small group sizes, and carefully crafted
            itineraries ensure you don't just see a place â€“ you experience it.
            We handle the logistics, so you can focus on the joy of discovery
            and create memories that last a lifetime.
          </p>
